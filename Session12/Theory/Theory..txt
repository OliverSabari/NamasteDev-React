useContext vs Redux :

useContext and Redux, both are used to share data across the components irrespective of where the components is placed.

When it comes to Large application, useContext becomes more complex and due to this our application will lost the readability and maintainability.
If we have multiple context, it becomes more difficult to manage.

Redux is very usefull for large application as it maintains the seprate store for managing the data.
Redux can handle multiple slices of our application.

useContext                                                                               Redux

useContext is a hook.	                                             Redux is a state management library.
It is used to share data.	                                             It is used to manage data and state.
Changes are made with the Context value.	                                             Changes are made with pure functions i.e. reducers.
We can change the state in it.	                                             The state is read-only. We cannot change them directly.
It re-renders all components whenever there is any update in the providerâ€™s value prop.	            It only re-render the updated components.
It is better to use with small applications.	                                             It is perfect for larger applications. 
It is easy to understand and requires less code.	                                             It is quite complex to understand.

Advantage of using redux toolkit over redux

Redux Toolkit reduces the complexity as redux is more complex to implement.

Official docs:
Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write
Redux applications. 
If you are writing any Redux logic today, you should be using Redux Toolkit to write that code!

-------------------------------------------------------------

Explain dispatcher:

disptacher is used to dispatch the actions.

const dispatch = useDispatch()

useDispatch() - This hook returns a reference to the dispatch function from the Redux store. You may use it to dispatch actions as needed.

Dispatch is used to send actions into our redux store and is the only way we can affect the store from within a component. 
This only works with function components.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Explain Reducer :

Reducer is the function which updates the slice of our redux store. There will be a multiple reducers fuctions for the different
types of actions. when dispatcher dispatch the action then it will execute the respective reducer function and updates the particular slice of our
redux store.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain slice :

A "slice" is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your app, 
typically defined together in a single file. The name comes from splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple "slices" of state

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain selector :

If we need to access the data/state from the redux store then the  component should be subscribed to the store so that it can automatically update whenver 
the state changes. So, useSelector is the hook which helps to subscribe our component to the redux store.

const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store.cart.items )

useSelector is the hook which accepts the function as argument and by default it has store as param and from the store we can select the state and save it .


------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain createslice and the configuration it takes : 

As the name tells, createSlice creates the slice or particular feature of our app. Redux would have multiple slices.

Config:

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name: "cart",
    initialState : {
        items : []
    },
    addItem : (state,action) => {
        state.items.push(action.payload)
    }
})

Things that we need to put it inside createSlice as objects,

1) Name of the cart
2)initial state of that slices
3)we can have one or muliple actions and declare the respective reducer function which updates the slice state of our redux store.
