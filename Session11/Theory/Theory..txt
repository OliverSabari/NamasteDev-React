What is prop drilling?

Suppose we have 4 components Parent, child, grandchild, grand grand child 

if grand grand child component need the  data that is present in Parent component, then Parent should pass 
the data as props to child and then child to grand Child and then grand child to grand grand child component.This is known as props drilling.

what is lifting the state up?

If one component need to change the data to their siblings component, then this is not possible. So, to do this we need to lift the state up to the 
Parent Component. Once the state is in the parent component then  parent will control all the child components.

Code example is in Instamart component.

what is context provider and context consumer?

Using Context provider , component can provide the its data to the value prop. Provider should be wrapped for the 
components that needs to use context values. It will override the default Value of the context.


Using context consumer, class based components can receive the context values. UseContext can be used as context consumer in functional based components.

Code example is in App layout and utils folder(context file)

----------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't pass the value to the provider does it take the default value?

If there is no COntext provider then it will use the default value which is created while using createContext.

If Context.Provider wrapped without value prop then react will throw error and value cannot be empty.
