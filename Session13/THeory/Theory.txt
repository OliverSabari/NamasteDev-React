What is Enzyme ?

Enzyme testing is only developed and meant to test the react components. It is developed by Airbnb.

Enzyme vs React Testing Library

Enzyme allows you to access the internal workings of your components. You can read and set the state, and you can 
mock children to make tests run faster.

On the other hand, react-testing-library doesn't give you any access to the implementation details. It renders the components and
provides utility methods to interact with them. The idea is that you should communicate with your application in the
same way a user would. So rather than set the state of a component you reproduce the actions a user would do to reach that state.

WHat is Jest and why do we use it ?

Jest is the javascript testing framework. It is not only for react, we can use jest for various projects like babel,typescript,angular,react,vue,node.

Jest is also widely preferred for automated browser testing, making it one of the most popular Javascript testing frameworks.
It also provides a blended package of an assertion library, a test runner, and a built-in mocking library.
